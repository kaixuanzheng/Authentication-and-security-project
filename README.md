# Authentication-and-security-project
In this project I implemented different levels of Authentication as below:
1) Level 1, plain-text username and password.
2) Level 2, database encryption, and using environment variables to keep secret keys safe by npm dotenv.
3) Level 3, Hashing Passwords with npm md5.
4) Level 4, Salting and Hashing Passwords with bcrypt.
5) Level 5, Using Passport.js to add cookies and Sessions.
6) Level 6, implement sign-in with google by OAuth 2.0.
